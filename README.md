# Resevoir water data in Spain
### Extreme weather events analysis (heat waves, floods, and droughts)

This water reservoir data is extracted from weekly hydrological bulletins in PDF format, provided by the Spanish Ministry for the Ecological Transition. The process involves scraping the PDF files, cleaning the raw data to ensure accurate and consistent formatting, and transforming it into a structured dataset suitable for analysis. Once prepared, the data is used to create visualizations that represent key metrics such as the minimum, maximum, latest, and average water levels in major reservoirs. These insights are crucial for understanding the current status of an important climate variable in Spain—water availability—particularly in the context of extreme weather events such as heat waves, floods, and droughts. These climate phenomena are becoming more frequent and intense, placing further strain on water resources and heightening the importance of monitoring reservoir levels.
